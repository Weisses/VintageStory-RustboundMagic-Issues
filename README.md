# VintageStory-RustboundMagic-Issues
Issue tracker for the Vintage Story mod Rustbound Magic

Things to keep in mind when using this issue tracker:

1.) !!!IMPORTANT!!! If you are reporting a crash, PLEASE MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE THE CRASH REPORT. Just the crash report. I do not want to wade through the last year+ of your client or server logs finding what I think the problem is. 

  Failure to do this could result in the auto closing of the issue.

2.) Feature request and suggestions are done through my Discord, not in the issue tracker here.
