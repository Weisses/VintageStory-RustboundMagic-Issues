# VintageStory-RustboundMagic-Issues
Issue tracker for the Vintage Story mod Rustbound Magic!

## Things to keep in mind when using this issue tracker:

1.) !!!IMPORTANT!!! If you are reporting a crash, **PLEASE MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE THE CRASH REPORT**. Just the crash report. I do not want to wade through the last year+ of a client / server logs finding what I think the problem is. Please include at least the whole top part and the first 5+ errors. Or just copy and paste it to the clipboard. 

  **Failure to do this could result in the auto closing of the issue.**

2.) Feature request and suggestions are done through my Discord, not in the issue tracker here.
