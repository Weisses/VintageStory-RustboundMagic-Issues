# VintageStory-RustboundMagic-Issues
Issue tracker for the Vintage Story mod Rustbound Magic!

## Things to keep in mind when using this issue tracker:

1.) !!!IMPORTANT!!! If you are reporting a crash, **PLEASE MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE THE CRASH REPORT**. Just the crash report. I do not want to wade through the last year+ of a client / server logs finding what I think the problem is. Please include at least the whole top part and the first 5+ errors. Or just copy and paste it to the clipboard. 

  **Failure to do this could result in the auto closing of the issue.**

2.) If you are reporting an issue, please don't test with 100+ mods also active. You should just test with the magic mod for magic mod issues. If you still see the issue with just the magic mod running in a world, then please let me know! MOST TIMES weird interactions result from another mod overriding core game systems that the magic mod needs. There is nothing I can do about it.

3.) If you have stuttering or lag and you have an Nvidia card, follow the link below to make sure you have the right in-game settings. I get this a lot. VS is NOT optimized. Magic requires more checks than most mods.

4.) The game will sometimes not fully load a mod. Chances are the game is pulling 2 versions of the magic mod. Multiple copies of mods can be found in the generic mod folder we all know, but as you connect to each server, random mod folders are also created to store the mods you download directly. I cannot help with this. All my mods are tested before uploading. Best thing I can tell you is to do 1 of 2 things: 

   a.) Reinstall the game. Idk if you did the 1-click installed the mod from the mod db site, connected to a few servers running the magic mod and downloaded copies of the mod, or just forgot to remove an old version thinking that disabling it in the game menu was good enough (it NEVER is). People with the issues do this and it just works.
   
   b.) (Worse way) Remove the mod, start the world, shut the world down, and readd the mod. People have had success with this. Note, block entites will have to be replaced and you could lose items if you were in the middle of crafting something on the thaumic foundry or oculus.

5.) Feature request and suggestions are done through my Discord, not in the issue tracker here.
